**Technologies Used:**
- HTML: Markup structure of the game.
- CSS: Styling and layout of the game elements.
- JavaScript: Logic and interactivity of the game.

1. **Start**: Begin the game by pressing "any" key.
2. **Gameplay Area**: A set of colored buttons that light up during the game.
3. **level Display**: Shows the current level number.
4 **Sound Effects**: Auditory cues for button presses and pattern playback.
5. **Game Over**: Notifies the player when the game is over.

**File Structure:**
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the game elements.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file for implementing the game logic and interactivity.
- `sounds/`: Directory containing sound effect files (button presses, win, lose, etc.).
